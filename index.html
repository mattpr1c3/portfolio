          <h2>Front-end Developer + Software Engineer</h2>

          <p>
            As a developer, I specialize in creating (and occasionally
            designing) modular and scalable front-end architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about web development, keeping up to date on the
            latest tech and techniques, and learning as much I can.

            <h3>Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component</h3>
            <p>
              Here is my solution to the Frontend Mentor's challenge entitled
              "Product Preview Card Component." Though it has no functionality,
              it has been extensively styled using CSS to look aesthetically
              appealing.

              Ever have the need to keep track of your daily tasks but don't
              want the hassle of having to use a pen and paper? With this app,
              you can add and delete tasks as needed and not have to worry about
              them disappearing due to its utilization of local storage (in the
              browser).
